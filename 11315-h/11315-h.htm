<h2>THE THREE LITTLE GNOMES</h2><br><br>
<p>A silvery thread of smoke curled up over the trunk of the old
tree and floated away through the forest, and tiny voices came
from beneath the trunk of the old tree.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="005 (137K)" src="images/005.jpg" height="1083"
width="695"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>Long, long ago, the tree had stood strong and upright and its
top branches reached far above any of the other trees in the
forest, but the tree had grown so old it began to shiver when the
storms howled through the branches. And as each storm came the
old tree shook more and more, until finally in one of the
fiercest storms it tumbled to the earth with a great crash.</p>
<p>There it lay for centuries, and vines and bushes grew about in
a tangled mass until it was almost hidden from view.</p>
<p>Now down beneath the trunk of the fallen tree lived three
little gnomes, and it was the smoke from their fire which curled
up over the trunk of the old tree and floated away through the
forest.</p>
<p>They were preparing dinner and laughing and talking together
when they heard the sound of a horn.</p>
<p>"What can it be?" one asked.</p>
<p>"It sounds like the horn of a huntsman!" another cried.</p>
<p>As the sound came nearer, the three little gnomes stamped upon
their fire and put it out so that no one would discover their
home. Then they climbed upon the trunk of the tree and ran along
it to where they could see across an open space in the forest
without being seen themselves. And when the sound of the horn
drew very close, they saw a little boy climb through the thick
bushes.</p>
<p>As the little boy came out into the open space the three
little gnomes saw that he was crying.</p>
<p>"He must be lost!" said the first little gnome.</p>
<p>"He looks very tired and hungry!" said the second little
gnome.</p>
<p>"Let us go and ask him!" said the third little gnome.</p>
<p>So the three little gnomes scrambled down from the trunk of
the fallen tree and went up to where the little boy had thrown
himself upon the ground. They stood about him and watched him,
for he had put his face in the crook of his arm and was
crying.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="008 (133K)" src="images/008.jpg" height="1086"
width="702"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>Finally one of the little gnomes sat down in front of the
little boy and spoke to him.</p>
<p>"I am lost!" the little boy said. "My father went hunting
yesterday with all his men and when they were out of sight I took
my little horn and followed them, but I soon lost their track,
and I have wandered about with nothing to eat. Last night I
climbed into a tree and slept!"</p>
<p>The three little gnomes wiped the little boy's eyes and led
him to their home under the fallen tree. There they finished
preparing the dinner and sat about until the little boy had eaten
and had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Then the three little gnomes carried him into their house,
away back in the trunk of the tree, and placed him upon one of
their little beds.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
</p>
<center><img alt="007 (16K)" src="images/007.jpg" height="181"
width="679"></center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>When the three little gnomes had finished their dinner they
lit their pipes and wondered how they might help the little boy
find his way home.</p>
<p>"Let us go to old Wizzy Owl and see if he can suggest
anything!" said one.</p>
<p>"Yes, brothers," cried another, "Let us go to old Wizzy
Owl."</p>
<p>So the three little gnomes went to the home of Wizzy Owl and
Wizzy Owl said he would fly high above the forest and try and see
the little boy's home.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="009 (69K)" src="images/009.jpg" height="682"
width="684"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>"I can not see his home!" cried Wizzy Owl. "Maybe Fuzzy Fox
can tell you!"</p>
<p>So the three little gnomes went to the home of Fuzzy Fox and
Fuzzy Fox said he would run through the forest and see if he
could find the little boy's home. So Fuzzy Fox ran through the
forest, but could not find the little boy's home. "But," said
Fuzzy Fox, "I came upon a wounded deer who told me that a party
of huntsmen had passed through the forest yesterday and had shot
her with an arrow." So the three little gnomes went to see the
wounded deer and they washed the wound the arrow had made and
bound it up for her.</p>
<p>Then the three little gnomes sat upon Fuzzy Fox's back and he
ran on through the forest with them until they came to a wild
boar.</p>
<p>The wild boar had been crippled by the huntsmen, he told the
three little gnomes, but had managed to hide himself in the thick
bushes and escape. "It must have been the little boy's father and
his men," said the wild boar. "I am sorry that I am wounded for I
would like to help him!"</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="010 (105K)" src="images/010.jpg" height="651"
width="888"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>Then Fuzzy Fox ran with the three little gnomes through the
forest and they met a wounded bear, and a wounded squirrel, and
five or six wounded bunny rabbits, and they all told the three
little gnomes that the huntsmen had shot them with arrows and
that they just managed to escape.</p>
<p>The three little gnomes felt very sorry for their wounded
friends and helped them all they could by washing their wounds
and tying them up. "We are sorry that we can not go with you and
help find the little boy's home," they all said, "For his mother
will miss him and cry for him. And we know how much a Mamma or a
Daddy can miss a little boy or girl, for we have all grieved for
our own little ones that the huntsmen who roam this forest have
killed. That is why we feel sorry that we can not help you bring
him back to his mother."</p>
<p>So Fuzzy Fox ran until he came to the edge of the forest and
then the three little gnomes saw a large castle away in the
distance with bright red roofs on the tall towers.</p>
<p>"That must be the little boy's home!" said one little
gnome.</p>
<p>"Let us return at once to our home under the fallen tree and
ask the little boy!" said another. So Fuzzy Fox ran with them
back to their home and the little boy told them it was his
home.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="011 (135K)" src="images/011.jpg" height="1095"
width="684"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>Then the kind Fuzzy Fox took the three little gnomes and the
little boy upon his back and ran to the edge of the forest and on
the way they stopped to see the wounded animals, and they were
all glad that the little boy's Mamma and Daddy would soon see
him. "Oh, if we could only see the children who have been taken
away from us by the huntsmen!" they said as they bade the little
boy goodbye.</p>
<p>So Fuzzy Fox carried the three little gnomes and the little
boy almost to the castle gate and shook hands with him.</p>
<p>"I will remember the way to your home," the boy told the three
little gnomes, "and I will be back to see you soon!"</p>
<p>The next day when the three little gnomes were preparing
dinner they again heard the little boy's horn, and ran along the
trunk of the tree until they came to where they could see across
the open space.</p>
<p>Soon there came a great many people, and riding upon a fine
horse in front of his Daddy was the little boy, but this day he
wore fine silk and satin clothes and they were not torn by the
brambles and bushes. Near him rode a beautiful lady. She was the
little boy's Mamma.</p>
<p>So the three little gnomes went out to meet them, and the
little boy slid from the horse and ran to them and threw his arms
around them. "This is my Daddy, and this is my Mamma!" he told
them.</p>
<p>The little boy's Mamma and the little boy's Daddy dismounted
and came to the three little gnomes and thanked them for
returning the little boy to them. "We will give you anything you
wish for!" said the little boy's Mamma and Daddy.</p>
<p>"We wish for nothing!" said the three little gnomes, "We live
happily here in the forest and our wants are simple, but if you
could send us some clean white cloths to bind up the wounds you
give our forest friends we would be very grateful!"</p>
<p>"I told Daddy of the wounded creatures!" said the little boy.
"Yes," his Daddy said, "and I have given orders that no one in my
country shall hunt through this forest, and from now on your
forest friends will be unmolested and can always live here in
peace and happiness." For the great king was sorry that he or his
men had ever caused any of the forest creatures any sorrow. And
after that the creatures of the forest were never harmed and they
grew up so tame they would wander right up to the castle, where
the king's men would feed them.</p>
<p>The tiny thread of smoke still curls up over the trunk of the
fallen tree, and the voices of the little boy and his Daddy
mingle with the tiny voices of the three little gnomes as they
prepare their dinner; for the great King and the little Prince
come often to visit their friends, the three little gnomes.</p>

<h2>THE HAPPY RATTLE</h2><br><br>
<p>Willie Woodchuck sat at the entrance of his burrow home
whittling upon a tiny dried gourd.</p>
<p>"What are you making?" asked Timothy Toad, as he hopped
through the grass and sat in front of Willie.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<img alt="013 (53K)" src="images/013.jpg" height="509" width="760" />
</center>
<br>
<br>

<p>"Oh, I am just whittling because I have nothing else to do!"
replied Willie Woodchuck.</p>
<p>So Timothy Toad hopped on down the path until he met Eddie
Elf.</p>
<p>"Willie Woodchuck is whittling because he has nothing else to
do!" said Timothy Toad.</p>
<p>"I will stop by and see him!" said Eddie Elf. So Timothy Toad
hopped along the path until he met Gerty Gartersnake.</p>
<p>"Willie Woodchuck is whittling because he has nothing better
to do!" said Timothy Toad.</p>
<p>"I will go down that way and see him!" said Gerty Gartersnake,
and she started down the path.</p>
<p>So Timothy Toad hopped down the path until he met Wallie
Woodpecker. "Willie Woodchuck is whittling because he has nothing
better to do!" said Timothy Toad.</p>
<p>"I will fly down and see him!" said Wallie Woodpecker, and
away he flew. Timothy Toad hopped on down the road until he met
Billie Bumblebee.</p>
<p>"Willie Woodchuck is whittling because he has nothing else to
do!" said Timothy Toad.</p>
<p>"I will buzz down that way and see him!" said Billie
Bumblebee, as he buzzed away.</p>
<p>When Timothy Toad arrived at his home his wife, Tilly Toad,
was sweeping off the front steps. "What do you think, Tilly?"
Timothy Toad cried, "Willie Woodchuck is, whittling because he
has nothing else to do!"</p>
<p>"Dear me! You don't say so!" cried Tilly Toad, as she stood
her broom in the corner and started down the path. "I will hop
down and see him!" she said.</p>
<p>"I will hop back with you, Tilly!" said Timothy Toad.</p>
<p>They had not hopped far before they met Eddie Elf, who was
singing happily to himself as he walked along. "Willie Woodchuck
is whittling on a rattle!" he said, when the two Toads stopped
him.</p>
<p>"We are hopping back to see him," said Tilly and Timothy Toad.
"I will go back with you!" said Eddie Elf.</p>
<p>They had not gone far until they met Gerty Gartersnake,
singing away very happily. "Willie Woodchuck is whittling on a
beautiful red and black rattle!" said Gerty Gartersnake.</p>
<p>"We are going back to see him!" said Tilly and Timothy Toad
and Eddie Elf.</p>
<p>"Then I will go back with you!" said Gerty Gartersnake.</p>
<p>They had not gone far until they met Wallie Woodpecker, who
also was singing happily. "Willie Woodchuck is whittling on a
rattle and it is blue, red and black and rattles
beautifully."</p>
<p>"We are going back to see him!" said Tilly and Timothy Toad
and Eddie Elf and Gerty Gartersnake.</p>
<p>"Then I will go back with you!" said Wallie Woodpecker.</p>
<p>They had not gone far before they met Billie Bumblebee.
"Willie Woodchuck is whittling on a beautiful yellow and blue and
red and black rattle and it rattles beautifully."</p>
<p>"We are going back to see him!" said Tilly and Timothy Toad
and Eddie Elf and Gerty Gartersnake and Wallie Woodpecker.</p>
<p>"Then I will go back with you!" said Billie Bumblebee, so away
they all went until they came to Willie Woodchuck's home.</p>
<p>"Where is Willie Woodchuck?" they asked of Winnie Woodchuck,
his wife.</p>
<p>"He has taken his beautiful new yellow and red and blue and
black and white rattle, which rattles so beautifully, over to
show to Grumpy Grundy, the Owl!" said Winnie Woodchuck.</p>
<p>"Then we will go there!" said the others.</p>
<p>"Then I will go with you!" said Winnie Woodchuck.</p>
<p>Grumpy Grundy, the Owl, was a very cross old creature, and if
everything did not go to suit her all the time, she hooted and
howled; in fact she had cried so much she had made large red
rings around her eyes.</p>
<p>When Tilly and Timothy Toad and Eddie Elf and Gerty
Gartersnake and Wallie Woodpecker and Billie Bumblebee and Winnie
Woodchuck arrived at Grumpy Grundy's place they heard merry
laughter and whenever the laughter ceased, they heard the buzz
and rattle and hum of Willie Woodchuck's rattle.</p>
<p>So they went inside.</p>
<p>And there was Willie Woodchuck with the beautiful yellow and
red and blue and black and white rattle, and when he rattled it
Grumpy Grundy rolled on the floor and laughed until the tears ran
from her eyes.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="014 (104K)" src="images/014.jpg" height="852"
width="909"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>So they all lifted Grumpy Grundy on a chair and wiped her eyes
and what do you think! the red rings around them were wiped away
and she looked young and pretty again.</p>
<p>"Oh dear!" said Grumpy Grundy, the Owl. "I have never enjoyed
myself so much before, and I will never be grumpy and be called a
Grundy again! No sir! never!" and her eyes twinkled with
merriment.</p>
<p>And all were greatly pleased at the great change in Grumpy
Grundy.</p>
<p>Eddie Elf laughed, Tilly and Timothy Toad chuckled, Gerty
Gartersnake giggled, Wallie Woodpecker beat a tattoo on wood,
Billie Bumblebee buzzed and Winnie Woodchuck sang a woodchuck
song.</p>
<p>And after that no one could say that Willie Woodchuck had
nothing else to do, for he spent his time making beautiful "happy
rattles" which he gave away to all the creatures, and everyone
laughed and made merry whenever they heard the beautiful yellow
and red and blue and black and white rattles which rattled so
beautifully and drove away the grumpies.</p>

<h2>RECIPE FOR A HAPPY DAY</h2><br><br>
<p>One morning Marjorie's Mamma called to her several times
before Marjorie answered, for her pretty brown eyes were very
sleepy and would hardly stay open.</p>
<p>"Come, dear! Please hurry, for I want you to run to the
grocery before breakfast!" Mamma called from the foot of the
stairs.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="015 (36K)" src="images/015.jpg" height="338"
width="875"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>"Oh dear!" exclaimed Marjorie, "I don't want to get up!" and
keeping her head on the pillow just as long as she could Marjorie
crawled out of bed backwards.</p>
<p>Her clothes were scattered about the room and her stockings
were turned inside out. Her dress would not fasten and she cried,
so that Mamma had to come upstairs and dress her.</p>
<p>So you see Marjorie's day began all wrong, for everything
started topsy-turvy.</p>
<p>"Now hurry, dear!" Mamma said as she handed Marjorie the
basket.</p>
<p>Marjorie slammed the door as she went out and she was so cross
she did not notice the beautiful sunshine nor hear the pretty
songs which greeted her from the tree tops.</p>
<p>"It's so far to the old store!" Marjorie grumbled to herself,
as she pouted her pretty lips and shuffled her feet along the
path.</p>
<p>"Hello, Marjorie!" laughed a merry voice.</p>
<p>Marjorie saw a queer little elf sitting upon a stone at the
side of the road. His little green suit was so near the color of
the leaves Marjorie could scarcely distinguish him from the
foliage. He wore a funny little pointed cap of a brilliant red,
and sticking in it was a long yellow feather.</p>
<p>Two long hairs grew from his eyebrows and curled over his cap.
He was hardly as large as Marjorie's doll, Jane.</p>
<p>"Who are you, and where did you come from?" Marjorie cried,
for she thought him the most comical little creature she had ever
seen.</p>
<p>"Why, I'm Merry Chuckle from Make-Believe Land!" replied the
elf. "And aren't you very cross this lovely day?"</p>
<p>"I did not want to get up!" cried Marjorie, "and I just hate
to go to the store! It's too far!" She dropped her basket on the
ground and sat down beside the elf on the large stone.</p>
<p>"Isn't it funny?" laughed Merry Chuckle. "There are hundreds
of children just like you who make hard work of getting up when
they are called in the morning and who remain cross and ugly all
day long!"</p>
<p>"I really do not mean to be cross, but I just can't help it
sometimes!" Marjorie said.</p>
<p>"Oh, but indeed you can help it, Marjorie!" the elf solemnly
said as he shook his tiny finger at her nose. "And I am going to
tell you how. First of all, when you awaken in the morning you
must say to yourself, 'Oh what a lovely, happy day this is going
to be!' then raise your arms above your head and take three long,
deep breaths. Jump out of bed quickly, always remembering to put
your toes on the floor first.</p>
<p>"For," continued Merry Chuckle, "Old Witchy Crosspatch is
always waiting for children to get out of bed backwards. And when
they do, she catches them by the heels and turns everything
topsy-turvy all day long; but when you get out of bed toes first,
I'll be there to start you on a pleasant day and Witchy
Crosspatch will have to return to Make-Believe Land and hide her
head!" "Sure enough, I did crawl out of bed backwards this
morning!" Marjorie said.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="016 (116K)" src="images/016.jpg" height="1100"
width="685"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>"I know you did, my dear!" Merry Chuckle giggled. "And every
time you do old Witchy Crosspatch makes everything seem
disagreeable!"</p>
<p>"But I hate to run errands, Mister Chuckle!" cried Marjorie.
"The old road is so dreadfully long and tiresome!"</p>
<p>"But the longer the road the more happiness you can find along
the way, my dear!" Merry Chuckle replied, quick as a wink, his
little eyes twinkling brightly. "If you look up at the blue sky
and the beautiful sunshine and sing with the birds as you run
along you'll find the road seems too short and you'll be back
before you notice it. Just try it and see."</p>
<p>So Marjorie looked up the road with a smile and, sure enough,
it did not seem so far to the store, and when she turned around,
she was sitting upon the stone alone. The little elf had suddenly
disappeared. Marjorie picked up her basket and skipped down the
road singing at the top of her voice and before she had time to
think about how far it was she was back home telling Mamma all
about the queer little elf from Make-Believe Land.</p>
<p>"You haven't been away long enough to stop and talk with
anyone on the road!" laughed Mamma. "Are you sure you have not
been dreaming?" Marjorie wondered if it really had only been a
dream, but the next morning when the golden sunshine peeped
through her bedroom curtains, Marjorie did as Merry Chuckle had
told her the day before. First of all she woke up and cried, "Oh
what a lovely day this is going to be!" Then she took three long,
deep breaths and then she jumped out of bed quickly, right on her
toes. And, sure enough, old Witchy Crosspatch had to go back to
Make-Believe Land and hide her head, so Marjorie spent a lovely,
happy day with Merry Chuckle.</p>
<p>"I hope all children will hear of my recipe for a joyous day,"
said Merry Chuckle, "so that each day for them can be filled with
sunshine and happiness!"</p>
<p><br>

<h2>GRANDFATHER SKEETER-HAWK'S STORY</h2><br><br>
<p>It was a beautiful day in the late summer. Tommy Grasshopper,
Johnny Cricket and Willy Ladybug were playing on a high bank of
the river, and watching the little fish jumping after tiny flies
and bugs that fell upon the surface of the stream.</p>
<p>"Let's go up higher so that we can see them better," Willy
Ladybug said.</p>
<p>"Yes, let's climb up on the tall reeds so that we can look
right down in the water," Johnny Cricket said. "But we must be
very careful and not fall, for the fish would soon swallow us,
and that would not be very much fun!" he laughed.</p>
<p>So Tommy Grasshopper and Johnny Cricket caught hold of Willy
Ladybug's four little hands and helped him to climb up the tall
reeds, for Willy was not as old as the other Bug Boys, and might
fall in the water if they did not help him.</p>
<p>From the tall reeds the three Bug Boys could look down in the
water and see the pretty little sun fish and the long slim
pickerel darting around and turning their shiny sides so that the
sun would reflect its rays on them, just as if they were looking
glasses.</p>
<p>The Bug Boys watched the fish until they grew tired, and they
were just starting down the tall reed when a great big dragon fly
flew upon the top of the reed and called to them.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="017 (54K)" src="images/017.jpg" height="609"

<br>
<br>

<p>Of course all the Bug Boys knew old Gran'pa
Skeeterhawk&mdash;for it was he&mdash;so the three returned to
the reed and sat down again to pass the time of day with
Gran'pa.</p>
<p>Presently Willy Ladybug saw a strange fish in the water.</p>
<p>"What kind of a fish is that, Gran'pa Skeeterhawk?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"That's a catfish!" Gran'pa replied. "Queer looking fish, the
catfish are; they do most of their feeding at night since Omasko,
the elk, flattened their heads."</p>
<p>"Dear me! Are their heads flat?" Johnny Cricket asked.</p>
<p>"Flat as a pancake!" Gran'pa Skeeterhawk replied, and then
told them this story:</p>
<p>"I've heard <i>my</i> Gran'pa tell that once the catfish had
heads that were shaped like sunfish," Gran'pa Skeeterhawk said,
"and they thought that they were not only the most beautiful fish
but the fiercest fighters in the world, although they would
always swim away as fast as they could whenever anything came
near them. You see, they really were not even a teeney, weeney
bit brave.</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="018 (50K)" src="images/018.jpg" height="465"
width="871"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>"But when the catfish got by themselves and they thought there
was no one else to overhear them, they would make up fairy tales
of wonderful adventures they had gone through, and fierce
monsters they had destroyed. One would say 'I wish I were large
enough to drag home the enormous giant eel I killed today. He was
sixteen feet long, and weighed five hundred pounds.' Another
would say, 'Pooh, that is nothing! Why, you ought to see an
Indian who tried to catch me in a net! Why, I not only pulled him
in the water and dragged him all over the bottom, but I made him
promise he would never disturb any of the catfish tribe after
this!'</p>
<p>"Just then a little bird flew over the water and his shadow so
startled the boastful catfish, they buried themselves in the mud
at the bottom of the stream.</p>
<p>"After a while," Grand'pa Skeeterhawk continued, "They got up
courage to peek out of the mud, and as they saw nothing to
frighten them, they formed in a circle and told more tales of
their fighting qualities.</p>
<p>"One old catfish who had been the leader because he could tell
the biggest tales and hide under the mud quicker than any of the
others finally said: 'We are the best fish in the water, as you
all know, so I think it will be a good plan to fight everything
that comes near the water from the land!'</p>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="019 (34K)" src="images/019.jpg" height="368"
width="875"></center>
<br>
<br>

<p>"'Shall we fight the big hawk who wades in the water and
catches some of us?' asked a little kitten fish.</p>


<p>"'Kitten fish should be seen and not heard!' the old chief
catfish answered quickly. I do not believe we should harm the
hawk. He is not large enough. I was thinking of the large beast
who comes wading along the shores and eats the grasses that grow
beneath the surface. You know he has to raise his head every
once-in-a-while in order to breathe, so if we should all hang on
to him we could pull him under the water.'</p>
<p>"So the catfish, although they were so frightened that their
fins grew stiff, decided that they would follow their chief, for
they expected he would be the first to hide under the mud when
the big beast came.</p>
<p>"Finally old Omasko, the elk, came down to the river to feed,
and the old chief catfish swam out and pulled on Omasko's
whiskers, and all the other catfish cried: 'See how brave and
fearless the mighty catfish are!' and they all swam out and
pulled Omasko's whiskers, too. This made Omasko very angry, for
he never harmed any fish in his life.</p>
<p>"He began jumping and pawing with his heavy hoofs, and smashed
all the catfish down in the mud and when they finally came out
again, which was not until two or three days later, their heads
were as flat as they are now!</p>
<p>"That is why all catfish have flat heads," Grandfather
Skeeterhawk finished.</p>
<p>"It served them right for being so boastful!" Johnny Cricket
said.</p>
<p>"It served them right for trying to harm someone who never
harmed them!" Gran'pa Skeeterhawk replied, as he darted up in the
air and flew over the tall cat-tails.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>CROW TALK</h2><br><br>
<p>"Caw, Caw, Caw," one old crow cried as he faced the other two
crows. "Caw?" asked the second old crow as he plumed his feathers
and screwed his head around to get a better view of the little
boy lying under the tree.</p>
<p>"Caw-AAAAH! Ca&mdash;aaaaw!" replied the first crow.</p>
<p>"Those crows must be talking to each other!" Dickie Dorn
thought to himself, as he lay upon his back under the big oak
tree and watched the three crows.</p>
<p>The third crow now cried, "Awww! Ca-ca-caw!"</p>
<p>Dickie jumped up and ran down the hill to where Granny lived.
It was a tiny little house, not much larger than a piano box, but
it was plenty large enough for Granny, for Granny was only two
feet high. Some people even thought Granny was a witch.</p>
<p>Of course Dickie knew that Granny was not a witch, for Granny
was very good and kind. So Dickie knocked at Granny's tiny front
door.</p>
<p>"Come in!" Granny cried. "Good morning, Dickie!" she said, as
Dickie crawled into the tiny living room.</p>
<p>When Dickie took a seat upon a tiny sofa he did not know just
how to ask Granny for what he wanted, so he twiddled his
thumbs.</p>
<p>"Why do you twiddle your thumbs, Dickie?" Granny asked, as she
smiled through her glasses at him.</p>
<p>"I was wondering what the three crows were talking of!" Dickie
replied. Granny went to her tiny cupboard and brought out a
little bottle of purple fluid. She dropped three drops of this
into a tiny spoon and held it to Dickie.</p>

<p>"Am I to take it, Granny?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear, and you will be able to understand what the
three crows are talking about."</p>
<p>Dickie swallowed the purple fluid, for he was very anxious to
return to the big oak tree and listen to the crows. Granny
watched him for a few moments with her eyes full of twinkles,
then she told him to run along to the tree.</p>
<p>And Dickie thanked Granny and ran as fast as he could to the
tree where the three crows were still talking.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="020 (59K)" src="images/020.jpg" height="527" width="902" />
</center>
<br><br>




<p>The first crow cried, "I know where there is a box filled with
golden pennies!"</p>
<p>"Ah, my brother, where?" asked the second crow.</p>
<p>"In the middle of the great meadow, and it will belong to the
one who finds it first!"</p>
<p>"I know where there is a box full of candy!" the third crow
cried.</p>
<p>"Ahhhh! Where is it, my brother?" asked the first crow.</p>
<p>"In the middle of the great meadow, and it will belong to the
one who finds it first."</p>
<p>"I know where there is a box full of ice cream!" cried the
second crow. "Aha! My brother, where?" asked the third crow.</p>
<p>"In the middle of the great meadow, and it will belong to the
one who finds it first!"</p>
<p>Then the crows went on talking about other things, but Dickie
did not hear them, for he was running in the direction of the
great meadow as fast as he could.</p>
<p>And when he came to the middle of the great meadow there was a
large box, and in the large box were three other boxes. One
contained the golden pennies, another the candy and the third was
full of ice cream.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="021 (104K)" src="images/021.jpg" height="832" width="684" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>"I found it first!" Dickie cried and he took a pencil stub
from his pocket and, with much twisting of mouth and thinking, he
printed his name upon the box.</p>
<p>Then Dickie ran home as fast as he could and told Daddy Dorn.
Daddy Dorn hitched up Dobbin Dorn and Dickie and Daddy went to
the middle of the great meadow and put the big box in the wagon
and took it home.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="022 (42K)" src="images/022.jpg" height="363" width="1022" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>Then they called Mamma Dorn and they all ate some of the ice
cream and candy. Then Dickie took some of the ice cream and candy
and some of the golden pennies to Granny.</p>
<p>Then Dickie ran back home and had some more ice cream and
candy, and asked Daddy if he might take some of the golden
pennies downtown and buy something, and Daddy Dorn said: "Of
course, Dickie Dorn, for they are your golden pennies." So Dickie
took two handfuls of the golden pennies downtown and bought a
fine little pony with a little round stomach, and he bought a
pretty pony cart and harness. Then Dicky drove the pony back
home.</p>
<p>By the time Dickie reached home he was hungry for more ice
cream and candy, so he went to the box to get some. "Oh Mamma and
Daddy!" he cried, "Come see! The box is full of candy and ice
cream!" And sure enough that was the case, for although they had
eaten almost all of the ice cream and candy before now the two
boxes were filled again. Then Daddy Dorn took two large handfuls
of golden pennies from the golden penny box and they watched the
box fill up with pennies again.</p>
<p>"Whee!" cried Dickie Dorn. "Whee!" cried Mamma Dorn, and
"Whee!" cried Daddy Dorn. "We will give a party!" So Dickie drove
around to everybody's house in his pony cart and invited
everybody to come to the party.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="023 (141K)" src="images/023.jpg" height="1088" width="701" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>And they all had such a nice time they ate the ice cream box
empty sixteen times and it filled right up again, and they ate
the candy box empty seventeen times and it filled right up again,
and Dickie and Mamma and Daddy Dorn gave everybody all the golden
pennies they could carry home and emptied the penny box eighteen
times, and whenever they emptied the golden penny box it filled
right up again.</p>
<p>And every one felt very grateful to Dickie Dorn and thanked
him for such a nice time, and Dickie brought Granny out of a
corner where she was eating her eighth dish of ice cream and told
everybody that it was Granny who had really given the party, and
he told them how Granny had helped him to learn crow talk.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="024 (36K)" src="images/024.jpg" height="401" width="908" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>So the people never called Granny a witch after that, for they
knew she was very good and kindly.</p>
<p>And Dickie put the three boxes&mdash;the candy box, the ice
cream box and the box with the golden pennies&mdash;out in front
of his house so that whenever anyone wished candy or ice cream or
golden pennies they might walk up and help themselves.</p>
<p>Dickie Dorn calls it an "All-The-Time Party," for there is
always someone out in front of Dickie Dorn's house eating from
the candy and the ice cream box and filling their pockets with
golden pennies.</p>
<p>Some day I hope to see you there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>THE FAIRY RING</h2><br><br>
<p>A little old man with a violin tucked under his arm shuffled
down the attic steps and the many flights of stairs until finally
he reached the streets.</p>
<p>As he shuffled down the street, he clutched his coat tightly
about his throat, for the air was chill and he felt the cold.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="025 (54K)" src="images/025.jpg" height="541" width="909" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>At the first street corner he stopped and placed his violin to
his shoulder to play, but catching a glance from the policeman
across the street he hastily tucked his violin under his arm and
shuffled on.</p>
<p>He walked a great distance before he again stopped.</p>
<p>It was a busy corner where hundreds of people passed every few
minutes, but when he played no one stopped to listen to his
music, much less to drop anything in the tiny tin cup he had
placed on the sidewalk before him.</p>
<p>Tears came to the poor little old man's eyes; everyone was too
busy to stop to hear his music.</p>
<p>So in the evening when he slowly retraced his steps towards
his attic home, his feet were very tired and he shuffled more
than he had in the morning. His back humped and his head drooped
more, and the tears nearly blinded him. He had to stop and rest
at each flight of stairs and he fell to his knees just as he
reached the attic door.</p>
<p>He sat there and rested awhile, then caught hold of the
doorknob and raised himself to his feet.</p>
<p>A quaint little white-haired woman greeted him with a cheery
smile as he entered, then, seeing his sad face, she turned her
head and tears came to her eyes.</p>
<p>"Honey!" the little old man sobbed, as he stumbled towards her
chair and fell to his knees before her, burying his face in her
lap.</p>
<p>Neither could say a word for a long time, then the little old
man told her he had been unable to make a single penny by
playing.</p>
<p>"No one cares to hear an old man play the violin!" he said.
"No one cares that we go hungry and cold! And I can still play,"
he added fiercely, "just as well as ever I could! Listen to
this!" and the little old man stood up and drew his bow across
the violin strings in a sure, fiery manner, so that the lamp
chimney rattled and sang with the vibrations of the strings.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="026 (120K)" src="images/026.jpg" height="1085" width="698" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>And in his fierceness he improvised a melody so wild and
beautiful his sister sat entranced.</p>
<p>As the little old man finished the melody he stood still more
upright. Then straightening his old shoulders and pulling his hat
firmly on his head, he stooped and kissed the old lady and walked
with a firm tread to the door.</p>
<p>"I shall make them take notice tonight!" he cried. "I shall
return with success!"</p>
<p>So again he went down the long flights of stairs and down the
street until he came to a good corner where traffic was
heavy.</p>
<p>There, with the mood upon him which had fired him in the
attic, he played again the wild melody.</p>
<p>A few people hesitated as they passed, but only one stopped.
This was an old woman, bent and wrinkled, who helped herself
along with a cane. She stopped and looked him squarely in the eye
and the little old man felt he should recognize her, but he could
not remember where he had seen her before, nor was he sure that
he had ever looked upon her until now.</p>
<p>At any rate, the faint memory inspired him and, raising his
violin, he played a beautiful lullaby.</p>
<p>Before he had finished the old woman leaned over and dropped
something into his little tin cup.</p>
<p>It sounded as loud as a silver dollar would have sounded.</p>
<p>"The dear old generous soul!" the old man thought as he
continued playing.</p>
<p>He played for hours, but the old woman was the only one who
stopped. "I will at least have enough to get Cynthia some warm
food!" he said, thinking of what the old lady had dropped into
his tin cup.</p>
<p>But when he looked, what was his dismay to see only a large
iron ring!</p>
<p>Again he climbed the stairs to the attic but he felt too weary
to say a thing and his sister knew that he had met with
disappointment. He tossed the iron ring to her lap and went over
to the bed and threw himself upon it.</p>
<p>"This is the end!" he said, and told her about the iron
ring.</p>
<p>"The old woman seemed interested in my playing!" he said, "And
perhaps she gave all she could give!"</p>
<p>"Let us not be downhearted, Brother!" said the sister. "Surely
tomorrow you will find someone who will reward your talent!"</p>
<p>The little old man was quiet for a long time and then he arose
and again drew his bow across the violin strings. The old lady
sat very still and dreamed, for her brother was playing one of
their childhood songs.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="027 (141K)" src="images/027.jpg" height="1095" width="695" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>As she lost herself in reverie, she turned the iron ring
around her finger and saw upon its surface, as she turned it, the
faces of her playmates of long ago.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="028 (112K)" src="images/028.jpg" height="1090" width="687" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>And as the brother swept from one melody to another, she saw
the iron ring change color and grow larger and larger.</p>

<p>And, as she turned it, she saw the figures of her childhood
playmates turn before her upon her lap, and they joined their
voices with the silvery notes of the violin's long ago songs
until the attic was filled with the melody and the figures danced
from her lap and, taking her by the hand, circled in the center
of the attic room laughing and singing.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="029 (56K)" src="images/029.jpg" height="703" width="689" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>The little old man had been playing with his eyes closed, but
as the songs grew louder he opened them and beheld the ring of
little figures, with his sister holding hands with two of them.
And, rising from the bed, still playing the childhood songs of
long ago, he walked to the center of the room. As he did so, the
figures rose in the air and seemed to grow lighter and larger.
And suddenly the scene changed! He was out in the woods, with
lofty trees towering above him, while all about, laughing and
talking, were hundreds of little fairies, gnomes and sprites, and
there, too, were the playmates of long ago, just as he had seen
them when he had closed his eyes and played in the attic.</p>
<p>And there, too, was his sister as she had been when a child.
He looked at himself, and lo! he was no longer wrinkled and old.
He was young again!</p>
<p>In his gladness he danced with joy, and catching his sister to
his breast he kissed her again and again.</p>
<p>And, looking about him with shining eyes, he again drew his
bow across the strings and played a tune so lively and full of
sweet happiness the childhood friends caught hands and danced in
a circle, and the little sprites, elves, gnomes and fairies
caught hands and danced around the children, and as they passed
before the brother he caught a mischievous glance from the eyes
of one of the little fairies, and he knew in a moment she was the
one who had played the old woman, and who had given him the iron
ring....</p>
<p>The people who lived in the room below the attic room missed
the little old man's shuffling step, and, not hearing it for two
days, they told the landlady, a kindly soul who had let the
brother and sister have the attic room free of charge, and all
went up to investigate....</p>
<p>They rapped upon the attic door. All was quiet within. Timidly
they opened the door and looked in. There upon the floor lay an
old rusty iron ring. It was the Fairy Ring.</p>

<h2>MR. AND MRS. THUMBKINS</h2><br><br>
<p>Thumbkins ran beneath the bushes and down the tiny path until
he came to where Tommy Grasshopper sat upon a blade of grass
swinging in the breeze.</p>
<p>"Have you seen Mrs. Thumbkins, Tommy Grasshopper?" Thumbkins
called.</p>
<p>"I have been asleep," replied Tommy Grasshopper, "And I
haven't seen her!"</p>
<p>"Oh dear! Oh dear!" cried Thumbkins. "She has not been home
all day!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps she went over to see Granpa Tobackyworm!" suggested
Tommy Grasshopper, as he flicked his wings and made the blade of
grass swing up and down.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="031 (75K)" src="images/031.jpg" height="613" width="652" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>So Thumbkins thanked Tommy Grasshopper and ran over to Granpa
Tobacyworm's house.</p>
<p>Granpa Tobackyworm was sitting upon a blade of grass, swinging
in the breeze and smoking his old clay pipe.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="032 (24K)" src="images/032.jpg" height="321" width="937" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>"Oh, Granpa Tobackyworm! Have you seen Mrs. Thumbkins? She has
not been at home all day and I can not find her!" cried
Thumbkins.</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw her early this morning going down the path with
her acorn basket," said Granpa Tobackyworm as he blew a few rings
of smoke in the air. "Perhaps she has gone to the Katydid grocery
store to buy something," Granpa Tobackyworm added as he bounced
up and down on his blade of grass.</p>
<p>So Thumbkins thanked Granpa Tobackyworm and went on down the
tiny path.</p>
<p>"Hello, Thumbkins!" cried a cheery voice as Thumbkins ran
under a bunch of flowers. "Where are you going in such a
hurry?"</p>
<p>Thumbkins saw Billy Bumblebee sitting upon one of the flowers,
swinging in the breeze.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Thumbkins has not been home all day!" said Thumbkins.
"And I can not find her anywhere!"</p>
<p>"HUMMMM!" replied Billy Bumblebee. "Let me think! HUMMMM!"
This was his way of thinking very hard.</p>
<p>"Perhaps she has gone over to see Granpa Tobackyworm, Mr
Thumbkins!"</p>
<p>"No!" replied Thumbkins, "I went there, and also over to the
Katydid store, but she was not there!"</p>
<p>"Suppose you climb upon my back, Thumbkins, and let me help
you find her!" said Billy Bumblebee, as he buzzed his wings,
making the flower sway up and down. So Thumbkins climbed up the
flower stalk and took a seat upon Billy Bumblebee's back.</p>
<p>"Let us fly way up in the air so that we may look down over
all the country!" said Billy Bumblebee, as he made his wings
whirr and climbed high in the air.</p>
<p>Billy Bumblebee and Thumbkins looked over the country
carefully, but they could not see Mrs. Thumbkins anywhere.</p>
<p>Finally Billy's sharp eyes discovered something shiny down by
the side of the pond, so they flew down towards it. It was a new
tin can house. The door was closed.</p>
<p>Thumbkins alighted from Billy Bumblebee's back and knocked at
the door.</p>
<center>TINKY-TINKY-TINK!</center>
<p>"GRUMP! GRUMP!" said a deep voice from inside the tin can
house. Billy Bumblebee peeped through a chink in a window, and
saw a hoppy-toad with his mouth full of pancakes.</p>
<p>So Thumbkins picked up a pebble and knocked louder.
TONKY-TONKY-TONK!</p>
<p>Old Man Hoppy-toad came to the door with a pancake in each
hand and another large one in his mouth. "GRUMP! GRUMP!" he
said.</p>
<p>"Where is Mrs. Thumbkins?" Billy Bumblebee demanded, as he
buzzed around Old Man Hoppy-toad's head.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="033 (30K)" src="images/033.jpg" height="300" width="914" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>"I don't know!" said Old Man Hoppy-toad when he had swallowed
the pancake.</p>
<p>"Yes, you do!" Thumbkins cried as he caught Old Man
Hoppy-toad's hand. "Who made those pancakes for you?"</p>
<p>Billy Bumblebee buzzed closer to Old Man Hoppy-toad's head and
Old Man Hoppy-toad blinked his big round eyes and finally said,
"She is locked up in the kitchen!"</p>

<p>So Thumbkins ran to the kitchen and came out with Mrs.
Thumbkins. Old Man Hoppy-toad had locked her in the kitchen so
she would have to bake lots and lots of pancakes for him.</p>
<p>Thumbkins was so glad to see Mrs. Thumbkins he came very near
crying. And Billy Bumblebee said to Old Man Hoppy-toad, "Now you
must leave our neighborhood, for we do not permit anyone to
bother anyone else in the Town of Tinythings."</p>
<p>So Old Man Hoppy-toad had to pack up all his things in a red
handkerchief and hustle out of town.</p>
<p>And Billy Bumblebee buzzed right around his head as Old Man
Hoppy-toad went down the path "Lickity split-Hoppity hop!" and
never once looked behind him.</p>

<p>Thumbkins and Mrs. Thumbkins went back home, and when Billy
Bumblebee returned and told them he had made Old Man Hoppy-toad
go 'way down to the river they knew they would never be troubled
with him again.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thumbkins said she had fried pancakes all day but she was
not too tired to fry more. So she made a lot of pancakes, while
Billy Bumblebee flew home and returned with a bucket of honey,
and they had so many pancakes Mrs. Thumbkins asked Billy
Bumblebee if he would fly around and invite all the neighbors in
to help eat them.</p>
<p>Tommy Grasshopper, Granpa Tobackyworm, and all the other
friends of the Thumbkins came and ate the lovely pancakes,
covered with the delicious honey.</p>
<p>And, after eating as much as they could, everybody caught hold
of hands and danced until late in the night, for the Katydid
orchestra was there to furnish the music.</p>

<h2>THE OLD, ROUGH STONE AND THE GNARLED TREE</h2><br><br>
<p>A great rough stone lay beneath a gnarled old tree. Years ago
a tiny squirrel had climbed upon the stone to nibble some nuts,
but before he had finished he was startled away.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="036 (23K)" src="images/036.jpg" height="325" width="750" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>"There!" thought the stone to himself as he saw a nut roll to
the ground, "now that nut will take root and grow into a tree and
I will have to lie here for ages beneath its branches. I wish the
silly squirrel had gone some other place to eat the nuts!"</p>
<p>When the little nut took root and sent its tiny shoots up in
the air, the old, rough Stone said, "There! I knew it!" and he
disliked the tree from that time on.</p>
<p>The old, rough Stone watched the tiny green shoot grow and
grow until it grew into an enormous tree.</p>
<p>"Just see how he pushes me up in the air with his roots!" the
old, rough Stone said to himself.</p>
<p>When the gnarled tree was covered with leaves in the summer
time, the old, rough Stone said, "Just see how he hides the blue
sky from my view!"</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="037 (27K)" src="images/037.jpg" height="269" width="744" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>And in the winter time when the limbs of the tree were bare,
the old, rough Stone said, "Just see how he lets the snow and the
cold rain fall right on me!"</p>
<p>One night during a heavy storm the old, rough Stone heard a
crash, and in the morning he saw the gnarled tree lying upon the
ground. "Now I shall be all by myself again!" he said. Then he
counted the rings in the trunk of the gnarled tree until he came
to three hundred, which was as far as he could count. "More than
three hundred years have passed since that silly little squirrel
dropped the nut from which this tree grew!" said the old, rough
Stone to himself.</p>


<p>Then men came with axes and cut up the tree and carried all of
it away.</p>
<p>When the hot summer days came the sun beat down upon the old,
rough Stone and he missed the shade of the gnarled tree. "My!
It's hot!" said the old, rough Stone, "I wish the gnarled tree
with its pretty rustling leaves were here again to shade me and
keep me cool!"</p>
<p>When winter came the old, rough Stone missed the leaves which
fell around him and kept him warm.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! How cold it is!" he cried, "I wish the gnarled tree
would come back and scatter his leaves about me to protect me
from the cold!"</p>
<p>So years and years and years passed, and the great old, rough
Stone lay all alone.</p>
<p>"I wish another squirrel would come to eat nuts upon me!" he
thought. "Squirrels are such knowing little creatures, I am sure
another might drop a nut which would grow into a lovely tree to
keep me company."</p>
<p>But, many more years passed, and never again did a tiny
squirrel sit upon the old, rough Stone and eat nuts. And never
again did another tree grow above the old, rough Stone to keep
him company.</p>
<p>"Ah me!" sighed the old, rough Stone, "We never know how well
off we are until we lose something we really need!"</p>

<h2>SALLY MIGRUNDY</h2><br><br>
<p>Sally Migrundy lived all alone in a tiny little cottage no
larger than a piano box. This was plenty large enough for Sally
Migrundy though, for she was a tiny little lady herself. Sally
Migrundy's tiny little cottage stood at the edge of a stream, a
beautiful crystal clear stream of tinkling water which sang in a
continual murmur all day and all night to Sally Migrundy.</p>
<p>The stream tinkled merrily through a great forest which lay
for miles and miles, a green mantle over the hills and valleys,
and Sally Migrundy's tiny little cottage stood in the exact
center of the great whispering forest.</p>

<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="038 (112K)" src="images/038.jpg" height="1112" width="695" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>All the wood creatures knew and loved Sally Migrundy and she
knew and loved all of the wood creatures.</p>
<p>Each morning she would scatter food upon the surface of the
singing stream and the lovely fish, their sides reflecting
rainbow colors, would leap from the tinkling waters and splash
about to show their pleasure. And she would place food about her
little garden for the birds and they in turn repaid her by their
wonderful melodies.</p>
<p>Even the mama deer brought their little, wabbly-legged baby
deer to introduce to Sally Migrundy; and she rubbed their sleek
sides and talked to them so they couldn't but love her.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="039 (67K)" src="images/039.jpg" height="551" width="898" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>Now Sally Migrundy had always lived in her tiny cottage on the
bank of the tinkling stream which ran through the whispering
forest. She had lived there when the largest trees in the forest
were tiny little sprouts. She had lived there long before that,
and even still longer than that, and that, and that. Ever so much
longer!</p>




<p>One day a man who lived on a hill many, many miles away from
the whispering forest said to his wife: "Mother, wouldn't you
like to know where the water that flows from our spring goes to?"
And his wife replied: "It must travel until it reaches the
ocean!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know that, mother" he replied, "but I mean, wouldn't
it be interesting to know all of the country through which the
water flows?"</p>
<p>So the more they talked of it, the more interested they became
until the man finally wrote upon a slip of paper and put the
paper into a tiny bottle. Then he put the bottle upon the surface
of the spring water and watched it float away.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="040 (80K)" src="images/040.jpg" height="834" width="681" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>The little bottle floated along, tumbling over the tiny falls
and tinkling ripples and bobbing up and down in the deep, blue,
quiet, places until finally it floated to Sally Migrundy's and
came to rest in the mass of pretty flowers where Sally Migrundy
came each morning to dip her tiny bucket of water.</p>
<p>And so Sally Migrundy found the tiny bottle and took it into
her tiny house to read the tiny note she saw inside.</p>
<p>It was such a nice, happy-hearted note Sally Migrundy said: "I
will answer it!" So she wrote a happy-hearted note and asked
whoever read it to come and visit her. Then she put her note in
the tiny bottle and sent it dancing and bobbing down through the
whispering forest, riding upon the surface of the singing stream.
And Sally Migrundy's note floated along in the bottle until a
little boy and a little girl saw it and picked it up.</p>
<p>And when they read Sally Migrundy's happy-hearted note asking
them to visit her they started following up the stream until
after a long, long time they came to the tiny little cottage.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="041 (82K)" src="images/041.jpg" height="693" width="916" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>Sally Migrundy was very much surprised to see the two
children, for she had almost forgotten she had written the
invitation.</p>
<p>"Howdeedoo!" said Sally Migrundy, "Where in the world did you
children come from?"</p>
<p>"We found a note in a bottle and traveled up the stream until
we came to your little cottage," they answered.</p>


<p>"But won't your mamas and daddies be worried because you have
been away from home so long?" Sally Migrundy asked.</p>
<p>"We are orphans," the children said.</p>
<p>Then Sally Migrundy kissed them and asked them into her tiny
cottage.</p>
<p>The door was so small the children had to get down upon their
hands and knees to crawl through. But when they got inside they
were surprised to find that the rooms were very large. In fact,
Sally Migrundy's living room was larger inside than the whole
little cottage was on the outside, for, as you have probably
guessed, Sally Migrundy's cottage was a magic house.</p>
<p>And in one corner of the living room there was a queer stand
with a silver stem sticking up through the center, and the stem
curved over and down towards five or six little crystal
glasses.</p>
<p>It was a magic soda fountain, as the children soon found out,
and they could have all the soda water they wished at any
time.</p>
<p>In another room were two little snow white beds. These
belonged to them, Sally Migrundy told the children. As you have
probably guessed, the magic cottage took care to make everything
comfortable for those who came inside.</p>
<p>And when Sally Migrundy had shown the children their pretty
bed room she took them to the dining room and there they found a
table which had everything nice to eat upon it. And so the
children ate and ate and ate, for the magic table knew just what
the person wished for who sat at it. So you may be sure there
were plenty of cookies and ice cream and candies and golden
doughnuts and everything.</p>
<p>So the two little orphan children lived all the time with
Sally Migrundy. And each morning when they tumbled, laughing and
shouting, out of their little snow white beds, they found
underneath a new present. So each morning they had a new toy to
play with, for the magic beds knew just what a child would like
most each day.</p>
<p>Sally Migrundy was very, very glad the children had come to
live with her, so she wrote more notes and sent them down the
singing stream, and more and more children came until Sally
Migrundy's house was very, very large inside, but still the same
tiny little cottage on the outside. The singing and happy
laughter of the children echoed through the whispering forest all
day, and the ground about the cottage was filled with toys and
playthings,&mdash;merry-go-rounds, sliding boards, sand piles,
hundreds of sand toys, and play houses filled with beautiful
dolls and doll furniture.</p>
<p>There was a roller coaster which knew just when to stop and
start so that none of the children could ever hurt themselves
upon it, and a little play grocery, a little play candy store,
and a little play ice cream parlor so that the children could go
there at any time and get cookies and candy and ice cream
whenever they wished. You may be sure it was a very happy place
to live and the children made Sally Migrundy very happy. At first
the creatures who lived in the whispering forest were surprised
to hear the happy laughter and to see so many children playing
about, but they soon grew accustomed to the children and came
right up to the grocery and candy store and ice cream parlor to
be fed.</p>
<p>Each year Sally Migrundy sends happy-hearted invitations
floating down the stream and more orphan children come to live
with her. However Sally Migrundy's tiny cottage is just the same
tiny cottage on the outside. But when once you crawl through the
tiny door, you look upon rows and rows of little rooms, each
having one or more little snow white beds in it.</p>


<p>And, while Sally Migrundy remains a tiny little lady only two
feet high, she has as much happiness inside as if she were as
large as a great big mountain, for as you have probably also
guessed, she is a fairy and can have as much room inside for
happiness as the little magic cottage could have room inside for
all the happy children.</p>
<p>One day the man who lived upon the hill where the spring
bubbles up from the ground and makes the beginning of the singing
stream said to his wife: "Mother, I will follow the stream and
see where it leads to!" So he started down the stream and walked
and walked and walked until the stream took him down through the
whispering forest clear down to the sea.</p>
<p>Then he turned around and walked back up the stream from the
ocean&mdash;up through the whispering forest until he came again
to his home at the top of the hill.</p>
<p>"I followed the stream down through a great whispering forest,
mother," he said, "until I came to the sea. Then I turned around
and came back the same way. It was a beautiful trip and when I
came to the center of the great whispering forest there was a
clearing at the side of the tinkling, singing stream, and the
lovely fish leaped from the crystal waters and showed me their
wonderful coloring, and the clearing was filled with beautiful
flowers and the music of birds. And it was so beautiful I stopped
and watched and listened.</p>
<p>"It seemed as if hundreds of children were playing around me,
and although I could not hear them yet it seemed to me that I
felt they were shouting and laughing at their play!"</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="042 (47K)" src="images/042.jpg" height="350" width="911" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>"How wonderful it must have been!" said his wife.</p>
<p>"It was indeed very wonderful, mother. And when I returned I
again stopped at the same place and sat and listened to the
singing of the waters and the birds, and I saw the wild creatures
come down into the clearing and act as if they were being fed,
and all the time I seemed to feel the laughter and happy shouting
of children at play. And a most delightful feeling of contentment
and happiness came over me as if I sat within the borders of
Fairyland!</p>
<p>"Then as I stooped to drink of the tinkling waters before I
started on my way home, I saw, tied to a flower growing in the
water, the tiny little bottle with the note inside which I had
floated off a long time ago, so I brought it home with me!"</p>
<p>And from his knapsack the man took the tiny bottle and placed
it on the table before his wife.</p>
<p>"I wish we knew just who tied the bottle to the flower!" said
the wife as she picked the bottle up to look at it. And because
the bottle had been used by Sally Migrundy, the two good people
suddenly knew all about Sally Migrundy, the magic little cottage,
and the happy children who lived there.</p>
<p>Every year the man takes his wife, and together they walk down
the tinkling stream until they came to the exact center of the
great whispering forest; there they sit for hours at a time,
feeling the happiness that overflows from the hearts of Sally
Migrundy and the children. And while the good couple have not
been able to see the children or Sally Migrundy, or even the tiny
magic cottage, they know they are all there, for at times they
can hear the laughter and once in a while they feel the touch of
a tiny hand. And when they return to their home upon the hill
they find they have received enough happiness at the clearing
beside the tinkling, singing water to last them for a whole
year.</p>

<h2>HOW JOHNNY CRICKET SAW SANTA CLAUS</h2><br><br>
<p>When the first frost came and coated the leaves with its film
of sparkles, Mamma Cricket, Papa Cricket, Johnny Cricket and
Grandpa Cricket decided it was time they moved into their winter
home.</p>
<p>Papa and Mamma and Grandpa Cricket carried all the heavy
Cricket furniture, while Johnny Cricket carried the lighter
things, such as the family portraits, looking glasses, knives and
forks and spoons, and his own little violin.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="044 (65K)" src="images/044.jpg" height="530" width="907" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>Aunt Katy Didd wheeled Johnny's little sister Teeny in the
Cricket baby buggy and helped Mamma Cricket lay the rugs and wash
the stone-work, for you see the Cricket winter home was in the
chimney of a big old-fashioned house and the walls were very
dusty, and everything was topsy-turvy.</p>
<p>But Mamma Cricket and Aunt Katy Didd soon had everything in
tip-top order, and the winter home was just as clean and neat as
the summer home out under the rose bush had been.</p>
<p>There the Cricket family lived happily and every thing was
just as cozy as any little bug would care to have; on cold nights
the people who owned the great big old fashioned house always
made a fire in the fireplace, so the walls of the Cricket's
winter home were nice and warm, and little Teeny Cricket could
play on the floor in her bare feet without fear of catching cold
and getting the Cricket croup.</p>
<p>There was one crack in the walls of the Crickets' winter home
which opened right into the fireplace, so the light from the fire
always lit up the Crickets' living room. Papa Cricket could read
the Bugville News while Johnny Cricket fiddled all the latest
popular Bug Songs and Mamma Cricket rocked and sang to little
Teeny Cricket.</p>
<p>One night, though, the people who owned the great big old
fashioned house did not have a fire in the fireplace, and little
Teeny Cricket was bundled up in warm covers and rocked to sleep,
and all the Cricket family went to bed in the dark.</p>
<p>Johnny Cricket had just dozed into dreamland when he was
awakened by something pounding ... ever so loudly ... and he
slipped out of bed and into his two little red topped boots and
felt his way to the crack in the living room wall.</p>
<p>Johnny heard loud voices and merry peals of laughter, so he
crawled through the crack and looked out into the fireplace.</p>
<p>There in front of the fireplace he saw four pink feet and two
laughing faces way above, while just a couple of Cricket-hops
from Johnny's nose was a great big man. Johnny could not see what
the man was pounding, but he made an awful loud noise.</p>
<p>Finally the pounding ceased and the man leaned over and kissed
the owners of the pink feet. Then there were a few more squeals
of laughter, and the four pink feet pitter-patted across the
floor and Johnny could see the owners hop into a snow-white
bed.</p>
<p>Then Johnny saw the man walk to the lamp and turn the light
down low, and leave the great big room.</p>
<p>Johnny Cricket jumped out of the crack into the fireplace and
ran out into the great big room so that he might see what the man
had pounded. The light from the lamp was too dim for him to make
out the objects hanging from the mantel above the fireplace. All
he could see were four long black things, so Johnny Cricket
climbed up the bricks at the side of the fireplace until he came
to the mantel shelf, then he ran along the shelf and looked over.
The black things were stockings.</p>
<p>Johnny began to wish that he had stopped to put on his
stockings, for he was in his bare feet. He had removed his little
red topped boots when he decided to climb up the side of the
fireplace and now his feet were cold.</p>
<p>So Johnny started to climb over the mantel shelf and down the
side of the fireplace when there came a puff of wind down the
chimney which made the stockings swing away out into the room,
and snowflakes fluttered clear across the room.</p>
<p>There was a tiny tinkle from a bell and, just as Johnny hopped
behind the clock, he saw a boot stick out of the fireplace.</p>
<p>Then Johnny Cricket's little bug heart went pitty-pat, and
sounded as if it would run a race with the ticking of the
clock.</p>
<p>From his hiding place, Johnny Cricket heard one or two
chuckles, and something rattle. Johnny crept along the edge of
the clock and holding the two feelers over his back looked from
his hiding place....</p>
<p>At first all he could see were two hands filling the stockings
with rattly things, but when the hands went down below the mantel
for more rattly things, Johnny Cricket saw a big round smiling
face all fringed with snow-white whiskers.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="045 (42K)" src="images/045.jpg" height="432" width="896" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>Johnny drew back into the shadow of the clock, and stayed
there until the rattling had ceased and all had grown quiet, then
he slipped from behind the clock and climbed down the side of the
fireplace as fast as he could. Johnny Cricket was too cold to
stop and put on his little red boots, but scrambled through the
crack in the fireplace and hopped into bed. In the morning Mamma
Cricket had a hard time getting Johnny Cricket out of bed. He
yawned and stretched, put on one stocking, rubbed his eyes,
yawned, put on another stocking and yawned again. Johnny was
still very sleepy and could hardly keep his eyes open as he
reached for his little red-topped boots.</p>
<p>Johnny's toe struck something hard, he yawned, rubbed his eyes
and looked into the boot. Yes, there was something in Johnny
Cricket's boot! He picked up the other boot; it, too, had
something in it!</p>
<p>It was candy! With a loud cry for such a little Cricket,
Johnny rushed to the kitchen and showed Mamma, then he told her
of his adventure of the night before.</p>
<p>Mamma Cricket called Papa and they both had a laugh when
Johnny told how startled he had been at the old man with the
white whiskers who filled the stockings in front of the
fireplace. "Why, Johnny!" said Mamma and Papa Cricket. "Don't you
know? That was Santa Claus. We have watched him every Christmas
in the last four years fill the stockings, and he saw your little
red topped boots and filled them with candy, too. If you will
crawl through the crack into the fireplace you will see the
children of the people who own this big house playing with all
the presents that Santa Claus left them!"</p>
<p>And, sure enough, it was so!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>THE TWIN SISTERS</h2><br><br>
<p>Everybody in the little village called them the twin houses
because they were built exactly alike. But the two little
cottages looked different even if they were built alike, for one
was covered with climbing vines and beautiful scarlet roses while
the other had no vines or flowers about it at all.</p>
<p>Everybody called the two cottages the twin houses for another
reason: the owners were twins. One of the twins was Matilda and
the other Katrinka and they were as much alike on the outside as
their two cottages were alike; but as their two cottages
differed, so did the two twins differ.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="046 (57K)" src="images/046.jpg" height="605" width="901" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>Matilda could not be told from Katrinka should you just see
them walking down the street, but the minute either of them spoke
you would know which was Matilda and which was Katrinka. Matilda,
who lived in the bare cottage, was sour and disagreeable, while
Katrinka was happy and cheery.</p>





<p>So the people in the little village called Matilda "Matilda
Grouch" and they called Katrinka "Katrinka Sunshine". All the
children of the little village loved Katrinka, for she always had
a cooky or a dainty in her apron pocket to give them, or she
would pat them on their curly heads and smile cheerily at them
through her glasses. And all the children avoided Matilda, for,
sometimes mistaking her for Katrinka and running close to greet
her, they would have their noses tweeked for their trouble.</p>




<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="047 (94K)" src="images/047.jpg" height="756" width="687" />
</center>
<br><br>





<p>Matilda's life was lonely and cold; no one went to see her.
She was always unhappy.</p>



<p>Katrinka's house always echoed with the laughter of children;
everyone went to see her. She was always joyful and cheery.</p>
<p>One night while Matilda sat at her dark window looking across
at Katrinka's house, she saw a crowd of people tip-toeing up to
the stoop with baskets under their arms and flowers in their
hands and when all had crowded upon the porch they stamped their
feet and made a great noise.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="048 (50K)" src="images/048.jpg" height="586" width="916" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>Matilda was very angry, but Katrinka ran laughing to the door
and greeted all with her kindliest smile. It was a surprise party
for Katrinka, for it was her birthday.</p>
<p>Matilda watched the party from her dark window and the longer
she watched, the more angry she grew, for the longer the party
lasted, the louder grew the happy laughter.</p>
<p>Finally when all the guests had gone, Matilda saw Katrinka
gather up half of the presents and put them in a basket.</p>
<p>Then Katrinka stole softly up to Matilda's stoop and stamped
her feet. Matilda sat scowling by the dark window a long time
before she finally went to the door, for she was very
peevish.</p>
<p>"This is a fine time to come stamping upon a person's stoop!"
she scolded, as Katrinka walked into the living room.</p>
<p>"Oh, sister," Katrinka cried, as she tried to kiss Matilda.
"This is our birthday and I have brought you half of the presents
which were given me! See?" and she piled the presents high upon
the table.</p>
<p>"I do not wish them!" said Matilda, frowning at her sister.
But Katrinka could see that Matilda <i>did</i> wish them.</p>
<p>"The presents were not for me, Katrinka!" she said.</p>
<p>"Oh yes they are!" Katrinka replied. "They were given to me
and I give them to you! I have saved one half for myself! But you
should have been to the party!" said Katrinka, "We had such a
happy time!"</p>
<p>"I do not enjoy being with people!" Matilda scolded, "I wish
to be left to myself!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but Matilda," her sister said, "you do not know the
happiness in being kind and friendly to others!"</p>


<p>"Pooh!" sniffed Matilda.</p>
<p>"I just wish you could take my place and know the happiness
that is in my heart tonight," Katrinka smiled.</p>
<p>"I just wish you could take my place and know the unhappiness
that is in my heart tonight!" said Matilda, "You would see that a
lot of children screeching about the house with all their
presents could not bring me happiness!"</p>
<p>Katrinka thought a moment, "I have it, Matilda! We will change
places! You must live in my house and pretend that you are me,
and I will live in your house and pretend that I am you! And you
must smile and be friendly just as I would do."</p>
<p>After a great deal of coaxing, Matilda finally agreed that she
would change places with Katrinka and try to smile when anyone
came to see her.</p>
<p>"But only for three days!" she said.</p>
<p>So Matilda went over to Katrinka's cottage and went to bed and
Katrinka stayed in Matilda's cottage, but she did not go to
bed.</p>
<p>Instead she went all over the house and tidied everything up
and placed pretty white curtains at the windows. In the morning
neighbors came to Katrinka's house, and Matilda, taking
Katrinka's place met them with a smile, and soon in spite of
herself she was laughing and enjoying herself.</p>
<p>And when they left, Matilda felt that she enjoyed having them
there.</p>
<p>But what was the callers' surprise when they passed Matilda's
cottage to see someone planting flowers around the stoop. They
stopped in wonderment and, as Katrinka looked up at them with a
cheery "Good Morning!" and a happy smile they could scarce
believe their eyes and ears, for they thought it was Matilda.</p>
<p>And these callers told other neighbors and they called at
Katrinka's house and visited with Matilda and Matilda was so
pleased she laughed as cheerily as Katrinka could laugh. And as
the neighbors left they saw Katrinka in Matilda's front yard
planting flowers and stopped in open mouthed wonder to gaze at
her, for <i>they</i> thought she was Matilda.</p>
<p>And when Katrinka smiled at them and said her cheery "Good
morning" <i>they</i> could scarcely believe their eyes and
ears.</p>
<p>The neighbors all put their heads together, and that evening
they filled their baskets with goodies and presents and, with
large bouquets of flowers, they tiptoed up to Matilda's front
stoop and stamped their feet.</p>
<p>Now Katrinka had called Matilda over to her own house to see
the changes she had made and Matilda was beginning to see what
she had missed all along. And as they were talking, there came a
noise at the front stoop.</p>
<p>"Shall I go to the door, Matilda?" asked Katrinka.</p>
<p>"No, I will go, Katrinka!" Matilda replied, her face alight
with happiness. So Matilda welcomed her guests as cheerily as
Katrinka had done the evening before and the laughter lasted
until 'way in the night.</p>
<p>And when the last guest had left, Matilda took Katrinka in her
arms and said, "I will not need to change places with you again,
Katrinka, for I have found that there is far more pleasure in
being happy than in being unhappy!" "Of course there is,
Matilda!" Katrinka replied. "You see, in order to be happy
ourselves we must reflect happiness to others, and the more cheer
we give to others the more joy we receive ourselves, so we must
continue to change from one house to another every other day so
that no one will know which of us is Matilda and which is
Katrinka and we will share our happiness with each other."</p>
<p>So Matilda's house was soon surrounded with beautiful flowers
and her house echoed with the fun and laughter of happy
children.</p>

<br><br>


<p>And the two sisters who looked alike now acted alike and could
not be told apart, and they changed about so often people never
knew whether they were visiting Katrinka or whether they were
visiting Matilda, for one was as cheery as the other and was as
happy in the love of all the people in the little village.</p>
<p>And, as they could not be told apart, everyone called Matilda
or Katrinka the Cheery Twins whenever they spoke of either.</p>

<h2>LITTLE THUMBKIN'S GOOD DEED</h2><br><br>
<p>Thumbkins lived in a tiny, cozy little house right down
beneath a mushroom. The tiny, little house was made of cobwebs
which Thumbkins had gathered from the bushes and weeds. These he
had woven together with thistle-down, making the nicest little
nest imaginable.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="050 (83K)" src="images/050.jpg" height="729" width="910" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>One day Thumbkins was passing through the meadow and it began
to rain. "Dear me! I shall get soaking wet!" Thumbkins cried as
he hurried along.</p>
<p>A mamma meadow-lark, sitting upon her nest, saw Thumbkins
running and called to him: "Come here, little man, and get
beneath my wing and I will keep you warm and dry!"</p>
<p>So Thumbkins crawled beneath Mamma Meadow-Lark's wings and,
snuggling down close to the bottom of the meadow-lark's nest, he
found three tiny little baby meadow-larks. It was too dark for
Thumbkins to see them, but he felt that the baby Meadow-Larks
were as warm as toast.</p>
<p>Thumbkins kept very quiet, for the baby meadow-larks were
sleepy little fellows, and before he knew it Thumbkins was sound
asleep himself, with an arm around one of the baby birds.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="051 (71K)" src="images/051.jpg" height="606" width="700" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>Thumbkins did not know how long he had been asleep, but when
he awakened the rain had ceased. Thumbkins knew it had stopped
raining for he could no longer hear the rain drops pattering upon
Mamma Meadow-Lark's back. So now he climbed out of the nest and
looked about.</p>
<p>The ground about the Meadow-Lark's nest was covered with tiny
puddles, and Mamma Meadow-Lark was soaking wet. She looked very
uncomfortable. Her feathers stuck out in all directions and a
drop of water fell from her head and rolled down her beak.</p>
<p>Thumbkins thought at first Mamma Meadow-Lark was crying, and
he said: "Are you cold, Mamma Meadow-Lark?"</p>
<p>"Yes, indeed!" Mamma Meadow-Lark replied as she shook her
ruffled feathers, sending the water flying in all directions.</p>
<p>"But, you see," she continued, "if I did not cover my baby
Meadow-Lark chicks they would get very, very cold, for they have
little bald heads with not a single feather upon them to protect
them! So, while I get wet, it does not matter so much, for I know
I have kept my little Meadow-Lark chicks dry and warm and cozy
and that, of course, makes me very happy! And I had the pleasure
of keeping you warm and dry, too!" Mamma Meadow-Lark added.</p>
<p>"Perhaps Mamma Meadow-Lark is very happy inside!" Thumbkins
thought to himself as he stood and looked at her. "But she does
not look very happy with such wet feathers."</p>
<p>"I thank you ever and ever so much, Mamma Meadow-Lark!"
Thumbkins said.</p>
<p>"You are indeed very welcome," Mamma Meadow-Lark replied, "and
any time it rains you can come back to my nest and crawl beneath
my wing and keep warm and dry. For you are tiny and do not take
up much room!"</p>
<p>Thumbkins thanked Mamma Meadow-Lark again, and told her of his
nice warm cozy little nest beneath the mushroom. "It is always
nice and dry there," he said, "for the rain runs right off the
mushroom and does not touch my little cobweb home!"</p>
<p>That night as he lay in his little thistle-down bed, Thumbkins
heard it thundering. "I'm very glad that I haven't a home built
right out upon the bare ground like the meadow-larks!" he said.
And as the thunder grew louder, Thumbkins turned over and tried
to go to sleep.</p>
<p>Presently the raindrops began to patter on the round top of
the mushroom and "drip-dropped" to the ground without getting
Thumbkins' little house the least bit wet. Usually when it
rained, the patter of the raindrops upon his mushroom roof lulled
Thumbkins right to sleep, but tonight Thumbkins lay wide awake
and thought and thought.</p>
<p>"I can't go to sleep!" Thumbkins said, so he hopped out of his
warm little bed and lit his tiny lantern. Then, though it was
raining ever so hard, he pulled his little hat well down on his
head and ran out into the storm.</p>
<p>Yes! There was Mamma Meadow-Lark sitting upon her nest with
her head tucked under her wing, sound asleep. But when he held
his tiny lantern close, Thumbkins could see that she shivered as
the cold raindrops splashed upon her back.</p>
<p>So Thumbkins ran to the woods where he knew the mushrooms
grew, and breaking off the largest one he could find he carried
it to where Mamma Meadow-Lark sat sleeping upon her nest, and
planted it so the raindrops rolled off the round roof and did not
touch her at all.</p>
<p>Then, shivering himself, for he was soaking wet, he ran home
as fast as he could, took off his dripping clothes, put on his
little pajamas, and climbed into his warm little cozy cobweb
bed.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="052 (24K)" src="images/052.jpg" height="248" width="856" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>Now of course Thumbkins was happy because he had helped
another, and when a person is happy there is nothing to worry
about, and when there is nothing to worry about, of course there
is nothing to keep one awake.</p>
<p>So Thumbkins fell fast asleep and dreamed the most pleasant
dreams.</p>
<p>And they were such happy dreams Thumbkins slept until almost
half-past eight the next morning.</p>

<h2>THE WISHBONE</h2><br><br>
<p>The stove lifter lay upon his iron side and looked across the
top of the shelf which stood above the stove. "Who is he?" he
asked of the box of matches lying near him.</p>
<p>The box of matches looked at the strange new object standing
upon two thin white legs and leaning against the wall near the
coffee pot.</p>
<p>"I do not know!" the match box answered.</p>
<p>Then they asked a number of other objects lying about if they
knew who the newcomer was, but none of them had ever seen
anything like him before.</p>
<p>When the new two-legged object with the bald head heard
everyone whispering he felt they were talking about him, and he
stepped out where all might see him, and walked up and down the
shelf at the back of the stove.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="053 (47K)" src="images/053.jpg" height="598" width="694" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>The stove lifter, the match box and all the other objects
watched him with interest as he strutted back and forth.</p>
<p>At last the new object stood still and with his head thrown
back he said: "I am a wish-bone, but as none of you know what a
wishbone is, I shall tell you! A wishbone is an object of great
importance in this world. Some of us come from the breasts of
chickens and some from the breasts of turkeys. When we are placed
above a doorsill in a house, we bring good luck!"</p>
<p>"Don't the people in the house here wish good luck?" asked the
match box.</p>
<p>"What a silly question!" replied the wishbone, "Anyone could
easily see you do not know much!"</p>
<p>"Then why didn't they place you above the door?" asked the
stove lifter.</p>
<p>"Because I have greater qualities than bringing good luck!"
the wishbone answered. "The children placed me here to dry, for
they have heard that I make wishes come true! And if you keep
your eyes and ears open you will see just what a great object a
wishbone really is!"</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="054 (43K)" src="images/054.jpg" height="514" width="924" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>All the other objects upon the shelf on the back of the stove
held their breaths to think such an important object deigned to
talk to them.</p>
<p>Then the children came romping into the kitchen. "Here they
come!" cried the wishbone. "Now watch me make their wishes come
true!"</p>
<p>And all the other objects scarcely breathed while they watched
the children as they took the wishbone from the shelf. They could
see how proud he looked as the children each took one of the
wishbone's legs between their fingers.</p>
<p>"I wish that this kitchen were just filled with candy and
cake, then we could eat all we wish to!" one of the children
said. "And I wish for a million golden pennies piled high upon
the kitchen table!" the other child cried.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="055 (42K)" src="images/055.jpg" height="613" width="658" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>"Now watch!" the wishbone winked to the objects upon the shelf
behind the stove.</p>
<p>The two children pulled upon the wishbone's legs. "Ouch!" he
cried. There was a loud snap, and the wishbone broke in two.</p>
<p>"I get my Wish!" cried the child with the longest part of the
broken wishbone, "The room will be filled with candy!"</p>
<p>"Watch the room fill with candy!" cried all the objects upon
the shelf. "How wonderful it must be to be a wishbone!"</p>
<p>But the room did not fill with candy.</p>
<p>"That's another time the wish did not come true!" cried one
child.</p>
<p>"They never come true!" cried the other child as the broken
wishbone was tossed in the coal scuttle. "Wishbones are just
ordinary bones and do not make wishes come true!" And the
children ran outside to romp and play.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="056 (31K)" src="images/056.jpg" height="414" width="936" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>"How much better it is to be a useful object!" said the stove
lifter.</p>
<p>"Yes indeed!" replied the match box. "And the more useful one
is, usually, the less he brags about himself!"</p>

<h2>TIM TIM TAMYTAM</h2><br><br>
<p>"This looks like an excellent place, Tim Tim!" Mrs. Tamytam
said, as she threw her little poke bonnet back from her head. "An
excellent place!" Tim Tim Tamytam scrambled up the root of the
tree and peered into the dark hole in the tree trunk. "HMMM!" he
said by way of reply, "Did you bring the candle with you, Tum
Tum?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot it, Tim Tim!" his little wife replied, "I will
run right back and get it!"</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="057 (28K)" src="images/057.jpg" height="312" width="936" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>"No, Tum Tum! I will run home and get it! You sit down upon
this soft little toad-stool and wait until I return. It will take
me but a moment!"</p>
<p>So Mrs. Tamytam sat down to wait upon the little soft
toad-stool, with her bonnet hanging over her shoulders, and she
sang and knitted.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="058 (34K)" src="images/058.jpg" height="428" width="879" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>Now, Mrs. Tamytam was a delightful little elfish lady, and she
and Tim Tim were very, very happy together, even though they were
only six inches tall.</p>
<p>So, while she sang and knitted, Tim Tim ran down the tiny path
made by the woodfolk, past the bubbling spring and around the
bend in the bank of the tumbling brooklet until he came to his
home, which was another hole in the trunk of an old tree.</p>
<p>As Tim Tim climbed into his doorway, he stood and looked with
dismay at what had been his cozy living room, for now it was
filled with sawdust and small pieces of sticks and twigs, for the
whole top of the old tree had broken off and now the rain would
splash right down on everything the first time there was a
shower.</p>
<p>Tim Tim Tamytam searched about in the sawdust and twigs until
he found a tiny bit of bayberry candle, and, putting this in his
pocket, he turned to go out of the hole. But just then Tom Tom
Teenyweeny walked in the door.</p>
<p>"Hello, Tom Tom Teenyweeny!" Tim Tim cried cheerily.</p>
<p>"Hello, Tim Tim Tamytam!" Tom Tom cried at the same time,
"What ever has happened to your lovely home, Tim Tim?"</p>
<p>"Well, I will tell you, Tom Tom," Tim Tim answered, "You know
Mrs. Fuzzytail lived with her grandchildren squirrels up in the
top of the tree, and they had a very cozy den up there, too, but
Mrs. Fuzzytail wished to make some small improvements, such as a
new peep-hole window and a little cupboard for Chinkapins and
hickory nuts. So last summer she sent for the carpenter ants and
arranged with them to do the carpenter work. And do you know, Tom
Tom," and here Tim Tim Tamytam put his hand upon Tom Tom's
shoulder and got very confidential, "those mischievous carpenter
ants, when they once got started, they sawed and chipped, until
they had cut almost all of the shell of the tree away, and when
it blew so very hard last night the top of the tree broke right
in two, where the ants had made their tunnels, and down it fell
with a great crash and made this great pile of sawdust and
sticks!" "Dear me!" said Tom Tom. "Was anyone hurt when the top
of the tree fell?"</p>
<p>"Fortunately no one was injured!" Tim Tim replied, "But our
home was ruined and so was Mrs. Fuzzytail's and Wally
Woodpecker's, the bachelor and we have been out looking for
another home. If you will come with me, Tom Tom, I will show it
to you, for now I have a candle and can look about inside!"</p>
<p>So Tim Tim and Tom Tom ran back along the tiny wood-folk path
until they came to the place where Tim Tim had left Mrs.
Tamytam.</p>
<p>There hung her knitting bag upon the stem of a flower, but Tum
Tum Tamytam was no where about.</p>
<p>"OOOHooooo!" Tim Tim called, putting his hands to his mouth
and forming a sort of horn. Charley Chipmunk stopped whittling
upon a hickory nut and peeped over the limb to see who
called.</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="059 (47K)" src="images/059.jpg" height="440" width="876" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>Mrs. Tamytam did not answer, so Tom Tom took a leaf and rolled
it into a horn. Across the small end he strung a fibre from a
piece of moss and with this elfin horn he blew the Tim Tim
Tamytam wood-call: "Tahoo Tahoo Tahoo-hoo-hoo!"</p>
<p>"That's the Tim Tim Tamytam call!" all the wood creatures,
said, as they listened.</p>
<p>"Tahoo Tahoo Tahoo-hoo-hoo!"</p>

<p>And as Tim Tim and Tom Tom listened, they heard away off the
answering Tamytam wood-call: "Toowoo-toowoo-tooawoooooo!"
sounding like the plaintive notes of the turtle dove but was
easily distinguished by any of the woodfolk.</p>
<p>Tim Tim and Tom Tom followed the sound of the answering call
until they came to a beautiful woodland glade. There, where the
sweet ferns and fragrant flowers grew in profusion and a carpet
of velvety moss spread upon the ground, they saw Mrs. Tom Tom
Teenyweeny and Mrs. Tim Tim Tamytam with tiny brooms sweeping out
a little hole in a great blue-gray beech tree.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="060 (78K)" src="images/060.jpg" height="650" width="918" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>"I came upon Mrs. Tamytam sitting upon the toad stool," said
Mrs. Teenyweeny, "and as I had just heard of this lovely home for
rent, she came with me to see it and we decided to take it!"</p>
<p>"And will Tom Tom and Mrs. Teenyweeny live with us, Tum Tum?"
Tim Tim asked.</p>
<p>"They have the little nook right across the hall!" Mrs.
Tamytam replied. Upon hearing this Tom Tom and Tim Tim caught
hold of hands and danced about, kicking up their heels with
pleasure.</p>
<p>"Just wait until you see inside, Tom Tom and Tim Tim!" Mrs.
Teenyweeny and Mrs. Tamytam cried, and then they led the way
inside the trunk of the great blue-gray beech tree.</p>
<p>And after they had inspected Mrs. Tamytam's home, Mrs.
Teenyweeny's Tom Tom and Tim Tim were as delighted with the new
homes as their tiny wives had been, so Tim Tim and Tom Tom ran to
their old homes and brought all their furniture and placed it
about the large living rooms.</p>
<p>When all was finished and the tiny rugs had been placed just
right, they heard a stamping of tiny feet in the hallway.</p>
<p>And as they ran to the door a merry, laughing crowd of tiny
creatures like themselves, each carrying an acorn basket, trooped
into the living room.</p>
<p>"It's a surprise party!" they all shouted and then one, Tee
Tee Tubbytee, a great speaker, said: "We watched you moving in,
and decided to have a nice, fine, lovely party for you, so I
called all the neighbors together and here we are!"</p>
<p>Some of the tiny creatures had brought their tiny violins and
some their elfin flutes, and as all were in a merry mood they
played rollicking airs such as "The Wind Tinkles the Fairy Bells"
and "Mother Hulda Picks Her Geese."</p>
<p>Tim Tim and Tom Tom danced and sang elfin songs. And then the
merry tiny creatures ate the goodies brought in the acorn
baskets.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="061 (49K)" src="images/061.jpg" height="379" width="897" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>After the dinner all the tiny creatures went outside, and upon
the soft, mossy carpet they held a wood-folk dance while the
silvery moon peeped down through the leaves of the woodland glade
and bathed the scene in fairy light.</p>
<p>When the first rooster crowed, far away in a distant farm yard
chicken coop, the tiny creatures, after planning another surprise
party the next moonlit night, bade each other good night and went
to their tree trunk homes.</p>
<p>So upon soft summer evenings, should you pass near the
woodland glade, you may hear the "Tahoo Tahoo Tahoo-hoo-hoo!" and
the answering notes of plaintive melody, "Toowoo-toowoo
Tooawoooooo!" For the tiny creatures have adopted the Tamytam
call as the call to the evening parties. And you must step
quietly and approach softly so as not to disturb the tiny
creatures, when you wish to see one of their moonlight surprise
parties.</p>

<h2>A CHANGE OF COATS</h2><br><br>
<p>Two mischievous little gnomes were walking along the beach one
day and as they came to a pile of rocks they heard voices. One of
the little gnomes put his finger to his lips for silence and
peeped cautiously around the largest stone. There he saw a crab
and a lobster sitting upon a bunch of sea-weed in the
sunshine.</p>


<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="063 (40K)" src="images/063.jpg" height="499" width="905" />
</center>
<br><br>


<p>The other little gnome tip-toed up and joined his brother and
when they had listened a while they winked at each other and
quietly walked back to the beach. After whispering together a
moment one of the little gnomes ran up the beach and over a sand
dune.</p>
<p>The other gnome again crept up behind the large stone and
listened to the lobster and the crab.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the crab, "I agree with you, Mr. Lobster! While
our coats are just a plain green they are still quite
beautiful!"</p>
<p>"Ah! You speak the truth, Friend Crab," the lobster replied,
"Green is a lovely color and I am very glad that we are not
purple!"</p>
<p>"I am very glad that we are green, too." the crab said, "Just
suppose we were colored blue! I know I should not be able to
stand it! Would you, Friend Lobster?'</p>
<p>"No indeed!" the lobster cried, "Nor would I care to change to
any other color, would you, Friend Crab!" "It is nice to be
satisfied! Isn't it, Friend Lobster?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Especially when we are as satisfied as we are!" The
lobster answered.</p>
<p>The little gnome listening behind the large stone winked at
himself and smiled. He knew the lobster and the crab would give
anything if they were of a different color, for he could tell by
their conversation they were dissatisfied with their green
coats.</p>
<p>Soon the other little gnome appeared over the sand dunes
carrying a large kettle, and when he got to a spot on the beach
where the crab and the lobster could see and hear him he began
shouting in a sing-song manner: "Old clothes changed to new! Old
clothes changed to new! Old clothes changed to new!"</p>



<br><br>
<center>
<img alt="064 (40K)" src="images/064.jpg" height="446" width="885" />
</center>
<br><br>



<p>"Pooh!" said the lobster. "Who is foolish enough to wish to
change their natural coats?"</p>
<p>"Hmm!" said the crab as he sidled towards the beach. "Let's go
over and talk with him, anyway, and ask him if anyone ever
changes the color of their clothes. Not that I wish to change my
lovely green coat, you understand, but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"It would be interesting to hear about it, anyway!" the
lobster replied, as he crawled after the crab.</p>

<p>The little gnome with the large kettle sat upon the beach and
pretended he did not see the crab and lobster, but continued
crying: "Old coats changed to new! Green ones changed to red! Old
coat changed to new! Old coats changed to new!"</p>
<p>When the crab and the lobster came up quite near the little
gnome pulled a number of pieces of colored cloth from his pocket
and placed them upon the sand.</p>
<p>"How pretty!" said the crab.</p>
<p>"Very lovely!" said the lobster.</p>
<p>"Do you wish your coats changed in color?" asked the little
gnome.</p>
<p>"Ah, no, thank you!" the two hypocrites said. "We were just
looking around a bit!"</p>
<p>"Well, I am glad to have your company," said the little gnome
as he took a piece of scarlet cloth and laid it over the
lobster's back.</p>
<p>"How do you like that?" he asked of the crab.</p>
<p>"It looks fine!" said the crab. "Try it on me!"</p>
<p>The little gnome placed the scarlet piece of cloth over the
crab's back.</p>
<p>"How do you like it?" he asked the lobster.</p>
<p>"Did I look that well in that color?" asked the lobster by way
of reply.</p>
<p>"I think both of you will look far better if you let me change
you to scarlet. It's in far better taste, too!" the little gnome
added, pinching himself to keep from laughing.</p>
<p>"Shall we change?" the crab asked the lobster and the lobster
asked the crab.</p>
<p>"You will find the color a great deal warmer," said the little
gnome. "Green is decidedly cold, you know!"</p>
<p>So the little gnome gathered an armful of drift-wood and built
a fire. Then he dipped the kettle into the sea and placed the
crab and the lobster in the kettle of water and put the lid
on.</p>
<p>"Be sure and make us a brilliant scarlet!" cried the lobster
and the crab, as the little gnome placed the kettle over the
fire. An hour later the two little gnomes lay upon their backs
upon the sand and yawned contentedly, their little round stomachs
almost bursting their belts. Near them was the upturned kettle,
and scattered all about them on the sand were lovely pieces of
scarlet lobster and crab shells.</p>
<p>"It's funny," one little gnome said drowsily, "how one
sometimes will become dissatisfied with the way he was made by
Mother Nature and try to improve upon her work! It usually leads
to misfortune."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," the other little gnome replied, "We
should be satisfied and contented just as we are!"</p>
<p>"Well, I for one am satisfied!" the little gnome said,
stroking his fat stomach.</p>
<p>"So am I!" his brother laughed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
